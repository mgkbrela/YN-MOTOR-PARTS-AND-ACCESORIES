          <h2 id = "article1"> What are e-bike classes? </h2>
          <h5>Evans Brasfield, August 27, 2021</h5>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"></div>
          <br>
          <p>Any new or evolving technology comes with some degree of vagueness, especially when it concerns legislation. That's definitely been the case with e-bikes, which have often fallen into the law-making middle ground; not being classed as proper bicycles, but not judged as a real motor vehicles either. It’s all been a little bit fuzzy. The same can be said about where e-bikes should, or shouldn’t, be ridden because of having a battery and electric motor. </p>

           <p> The situation is improving though, because most electric bikes now fall into one of three different classes. Back in 2020 the e-bike industry decided to get together and come up with a plan, which has resulted in the creation of Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 categories. </p>
            
            <p>Simple, right? Well, not quite because although the class system is now recognised by over half the US states, it’s still not a truly definitive classification system.</p>
        
            <b>E-bike Class 1</b>
<p>Class 1 electric bikes have a speed limitation of 20 miles per hour, and the classification is made simpler by the fact that the electric motor only assists the rider when they’re pedalling. You may find that the e-bike has a throttle, usually mounted on the handlebars, but this will only provide a boost. The basic setup can obviously vary depending on the make and model of electric bike.

As a result, Class 1 e-bikes usually get to enjoy all the privileges afforded to regular pedal cycles, which means general access to bike paths and designated lanes. This is also the only type of e-bike that's not classified as a moped in the UK and EU.

The VanMoof S3/X3 models are good examples of this class, along with the rather good Cannondale Quick Neo SL.
    </p>    

    <b>E-bike Class 2</b>
<p>Class 2 bikes come with the same 20mph speed limitation, but can deliver power from the battery and motor combination using a throttle, even if you’re not pedalling. Some electric bikes in this class can do a mix of both, with the motor doing all the work, a combination of motor and pedal assistance.

Much like the Class 1 category, many countries allow you to ride a Class 2 e-bike on bike paths and lanes. Look out for the likes of the Aventon Pace 350 or the Wing Freedom 2 as a pair of prime examples. </p>
          
<b>
  E-bike Class 3
</b>
<p>Class 3 e-bikes make things rather more complicated. Class 3 e-bikes are likely to have a throttle setup as part of the design, their speed allowance is a higher 28 miles per hour, and their motor limit is 750 Watts, but it's not so clear-cut where you can ride them.

  The exact rules will depend on the country and city you're in. For example, you don’t need a license to ride one of these bikes in the US, but you should exercise caution about where you ride the two-wheeler, such as on regular roads and designated bike lanes. They’re not usually allowed on multiuse paths or bike trails though. 
  
  It’s really worth checking city and state rules before you buy a Class 3 bike, to make sure it’ll fall in line with local regulations. Remember this point if you’re taking your e-bike out of state too. The excellent Specialized Turbo Vado SL Equipped is a great e-bike in this class, but the Trek Domane+ HP is a very worthy alternative too.

          <h2 id = "article2">Black Magic: Motorcycle Tires <br>
            <i>What you don’t know can hurt you</i></h2>
          <h5>Rob Clymo, April 24, 2022</h5>
          <p>As motorcyclists, we are well aware of how important tires are. Our ride – even our survival – depends on just a few square inches of rubber. So, why is it that rarely does a week go by in which we don’t see a motorcycle out on the road with visibly under-inflated tires? These are tires that are way past the point of affecting handling and into the zone of being dangerous. Perhaps it’s because tire technology has advanced so much in recent decades that we take them for granted. It used to be that one of the easiest upgrades you could make to your bike – particularly for sport-focused riders – was getting rid of the OEM tires and spooning on some aftermarket rubber. Now, street tires can offer grip that would surprise racers from a decade ago while still delivering reasonable mileage. Additionally, less performance-oriented tires are now capable of considerably more wet-weather grip and durability, a real boon to commuters and touring riders.</p>
        <b>Choose the right tire for the job</b>
        <p>Radial tires have their carcass constructed with their cords running directly across the tire from bead-to-bead perpendicular to the tire’s rotation. This construction with fewer layers of body cord allows for a more supple sidewall, which helps make the contact patch larger when the tire is on the edge of its tread. Not surprisingly, performance-oriented motorcycles primarily utilize radial tires because of the higher grip and improved feedback the more supple sidewall allows. Another feature of radial tires is their ability to have short sidewalls with wide treads. Look at your typical sportbike rear tire’s dimensions. They simply wouldn’t be possible with bias ply tires.</p>
        <p><b>Oscar Solis, Senior Roadrace Manager, North and South America Metzeler/Pirelli:</b> <i>“If you have a really sporty compound, if it’s an ultra-race compound like our Pirelli SC0, they’re not made to be at 120 degrees. They’re made to be at 200-plus degrees Fahrenheit. It’s very difficult to get that kind of heat in the tire on the street – with an SC0 or any kind of tire. So, your ultra-race compounds are actually going to be a harder compound at a lower temperature. Even if you had the skills to ride the bike to generate the heat on the track, you most likely won’t be able to get that much heat on the street. So that’s why you shouldn’t have race compounds as street tires.”</i></p>
        <p><b>Ashley Vowles, Avon Motorcycle Tire Development Manager: </b> <i>“From a tire standpoint, they are designed very differently specifically to application. Hypersport track tires are designed to be very stable at high-speed. They’re designed to provide optimal grip at higher operating temperatures, and the profiles are designed a lot sharper to enable the bike to turn it in and fall right onto the edge of the tire when the rider is going around corners and hitting the apexes.</i></p>
        <p><i>“When looking at sport-touring tires, they are slightly similar to hypersport tires, but the construction is slightly different. The track tire/sport tire has quite a lot stiffer construction so that the rider gets optimal feedback from the tire. Whereas sport touring is slightly softer in construction to improve rider comfort. But also the profile is slightly flatter than a sports tire. Sport-touring tires offer a little more footprint because they’re upright a lot longer than on a sport tire.</i></p>
<p><i>“Also, you generally get dual compounds on the rear of those tires. The sport-touring tire is designed for high mileage. Sport-touring tires people kind of refer to them as the all around, all season type tire. People are commuting on them. People are using them all year round. They’ve got good dry performance, good wet performance, good longevity, good handling and stability.”</i></p>

<b>The most common mistake</b>
<p>Let us pause for a moment of silence to consider the suffering inflicted on motorcycle tires by neglectful owners – and let their tales of woe be a warning.</p>
<i></i>
<blockquote> “At rallies, we would set up a tire check, people would come through with their motorcycle, and we would check their weight and pressure. We’d have them roll up on the scale and sit on the bike with everything, their luggage, the wife on the back, and we would get the weights front and rear. Then we would check their pressure. And the number of under inflated tires was surprising. We even came across some riders with less than 10 psi in their tires. It was kind of scary and comical at the same time. We’re telling people, you don’t understand how important this is.</blockquote>     
<blockquote>"We found in our testing that you’re going to get the best mileage bang for your buck on the street if you maintain the placard pressure. As soon as you lower that pressure, you’re putting more heat cycles into the tire. You’re definitely generating more flex in the carcass, and that’s going to wear the tire out. I couldn’t tell you how much quicker. I know that it’s pretty obvious to me when I have seen a street motorcycle running too low air pressure, either it wears out too quickly or wear is uneven. You get cupping.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “Check your pressure. Every time you go out on a ride. Nobody ever does it, but I’m still going to suggest that you do it. Check your pressure every time – especially when the weather changes. That’s what really changes the pressure in the tire. Heat is generated in a tire by deflection, by how much it squishes, basically. On the road, less pressure is going to create more heat. That’s why big truck drivers in semis get blowouts when the pressure is too low. It creates more heat. The heat’s not so much on the surface. It’s actually under the surface. That’s why you see the tread come off.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  “The one stat that I always talk about is that you should look at tire wear as a bell curve. The optimum pressures in the middle. If you go ten percent either way on your pressures, then tire wear literally drops off the bell curve.

“So, your optimum wear rate is at 42 PSI. If you go plus or minus on the 10% rule, and a lot of riders will for a 42 PSI recommendation. They will probably drop that down to 34 or 35, but even 10% so from 42, that’s about 38 PSI. Even if you’re 38, that will, in some cases, increase your wear rate by 50%. So, you will get half the mileage out of your tire by running it between 35 and 38 than you would do at 42 PSI.”
</blockquote></i>

          <p>Oh boy. Without a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of all of the motorcycle-specific oils on the market including a detailed description of what “the best” means to ensure we’re talking objectively, I can’t really say. That’s not what we’re trying to do with this article. Like motorcycles these days, there are so many good oils on the market, you’d be hard-pressed to go wrong with any of them. Routine maintenance, following your manufacturer’s recommendations, and a little bit of scrutiny to make it past the marketing hype will go a long way toward ensuring that your motorcycle’s engine remains healthy and happy.</p>
       <p>
        That being said, there are other variables to consider. The weather where you ride, the type of motorcycle you’re riding, whether you’re riding a competition-only off-highway (street or dirt), among others. For my personal motorcycles, I use the manufacturers’ recommendations all the way down to the brand in my road bikes (even though I know it isn’t necessary). My dirtbikes get their oil changed much more often and I use Shell Rotella because it’s cheap and meets JASO MA2 specs. Things like price, availability, and personal preference have a lot to do with purchasing decisions, too. Oil grades (weights), as well as PAOs, Ester-based, and petroleum-based oils, are other variables and a conversation for another time. The information below should be enough to ensure you pick the right kind of oil to keep your motorcycle performing as it should.
